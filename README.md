# Revenue (Fundraising and Earned Revenue) Community of Practice 

Welcome to the Revenue Committee. We are happy you are here!


# Project title and description

Hack for LA is committed to becoming a sustainable organization where volunteers can get experience that helps them achieve their professional goals and collectively we all contribute to projects that create measurable positive impact on Civic life in LA and help grow the Civic Tech eco-system.

The Revenue Committee is part of the our org structure.  [See our Communities of Practices](https://github.com/hackforla/communities-of-practice/blob/main/README.md) for other functional areas.
